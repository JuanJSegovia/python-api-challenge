Weather and Vacation Planner
Overview
This project is designed to help users analyze weather data for cities worldwide and assist in planning vacations based on ideal weather conditions. The project utilizes APIs to retrieve and visualize weather data and find nearby hotels.

Project Structure
WeatherPy.ipynb:
A Jupyter notebook that retrieves and visualizes weather data for over 500 cities. It creates scatter plots to show the relationship between weather variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed) and latitude.

VacationPy.ipynb:
A Jupyter notebook that helps plan vacations by narrowing down cities based on specific weather criteria. It also uses the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels and displays the results on an interactive map.

cities.csv:
A CSV file that contains data on selected cities, including latitude, longitude, humidity, and the name of the nearest hotel.


Summary
This project combines weather data analysis with vacation planning tools, enabling users to identify suitable vacation spots based on weather conditions and find nearby hotels with ease. The visualizations and data are all presented within interactive Jupyter notebooks.
